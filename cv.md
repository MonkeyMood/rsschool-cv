### About me:

I have 2 diplomas, but I see these professions only as assistants, and my goal is __to become a frontend developer!__

I am ideological, disciplined, I like to study new information and "break my brain" by solving complex problems.
I love people. I can work in a team and easily explain complex things. I can find a common language in any team.

I believe that `nothing is impossible and absolutely everything CAN BE LEARNED!`

### Skills:
